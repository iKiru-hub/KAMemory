## Interests
- type and properties of the representations in CA1, CA3, EC
- how these representations can be maintained/formed through plasticity

EC --- CA1
 .     /
  .   /
   CA3

*representation* neural trace/structure
*question about representation* how/what we can decode from it

- solve the problem:
    -> episodic memory, as an efficient way to store and retrieve relevant information

**connection with Albert's work**
- study of the memory component (HPC), ie episodic memory


## Motivations

From previous work:
- index function: eg. bar-code in CA3, or pointer to CA1 content
- content function: rich representation in CA3, that can be associated to CA1

- *are these two views compatible?*
- *btsp can be used for forming representations in CA1* (other rules will be used)

The PFC is just a controller in this case, but it is not the focus.
