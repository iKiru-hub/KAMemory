**pre-meeting 15.6.25**


In Experiment I:
- plot the quality decay distribution of a memory over time

In Experiment III:
- include the results from the second cue (different pattern) in the test statistics
- define better what's interesting in the test comparison, is it just the evaluation of the importance of sensory information (which is the same) ?


**meeting 20.6.25**

- performance distribution for the last pattern(blue 7) in fig 1B (poster)
