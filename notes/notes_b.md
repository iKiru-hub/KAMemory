**Main points**
- maintaining decodability
- nature of the IS

**Figure 1** - proof of concept
- model architecture
- weight change kernel
- memory capacity plot

**Figure 2** - ~ experiments
- problem layout
- experimental layout (sensory+space)

**Figure 3** *?*
- results

**more things to look at**
- delve more into the IS, plot odd vs even laps (sorting for odd) see plot in figure 4 from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05378-6.pdf
- IS in CA1 activity when moving the sensory cue in space | Hypothesis: object invariant cells CA1 (object vector cells?)
