**Meeting 20.8.24**

weights EC $\to$ CA3 as an invertible matrix

capacity:
- pattern length 
- number of patterns

Roadmap:
- *week 1*: simulation results
- *week 2*: experimental relevance (fit)
- *week 3*: experimental predictions

**notes**
- plot the distribution of activations in $CA1$ and $EC_{out}$ to check that the average norm increases with low values of $\alpha$


**Slides**
1. summary of BTSP, papers and overview
2. question: *decodability problem*
3. describe the model and the choices in light of a minimalist drive
4. explain figure (4) and how our rule is a simplified version (it approximates the original rule) as a square function, with LTP and LTD acting immediately with the pairing IS-ET
5. explain the architecture and its online/offline dynamics, areas and training
6. describe the simulation setup + nice figures
7. topic: how to merge it with experimental evidence? what predictions can be made?



**meeting** 24.9.24

- ecological task (no sp/nsp distinction)
- random IS: same shape but random entries (i.e. as if it was shuffled) | bc BTSP meant to be random somehow



**Meeting** 8.10.24

- fewer patterns
- deadline for 10

Linear track:
- simpler
- experiments are mostly using it
- sensory cue spread over the environment

Autoencoder:
- mixed inputs (spatial + non-spatial)
- obtain spatial cells in the latent layer
