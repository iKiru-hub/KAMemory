The main points are.

**memory recall accuracy**
    - dependancy on the learning rate
    - dependancy on the internal sparsity

- link to experimental parameters and see the effects


**CA1 neuron tuning**
    - tuning specialization spatial-nonspatial
    - experimental reproduction


### planning

- [ ] learning rate plot
- [ ] internal sparsity plot

- [ ] experimental protocol diagram
- [ ] spatial tuning
- [ ] mixed and nonspatial tuning
- [ ] invariant nonspatial tuning during object relocation
