To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of two binary random vectors with specific properties having a varying number of common active entries. Let's break this down step by step.

## Problem Setup

We have:
- Two binary vectors of size N
- Each vector has exactly K active entries (1s)
- We want to find the probability of having 0, 1, ..., K entries in common

## Probability Calculation

The probability of having exactly i entries in common can be calculated using the hypergeometric distribution, which describes the probability of k successes in n draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size N containing K successes.

For our case:
- Population size: N
- Number of successes in population: K (active entries in first vector)
- Sample size: K (active entries in second vector)
- Number of observed successes: i (common active entries)

The probability formula is:

$$P(X = i) = \frac{\binom{K}{i}\binom{N-K}{K-i}}{\binom{N}{K}}$$

Where:
- X is the random variable representing the number of common active entries
- i ranges from 0 to K

## Probabilities for Each Case

Let's calculate the probability for each case:

1. **0 entries in common:**
   $$P(X = 0) = \frac{\binom{K}{0}\binom{N-K}{K}}{\binom{N}{K}}$$

2. **1 entry in common:**
   $$P(X = 1) = \frac{\binom{K}{1}\binom{N-K}{K-1}}{\binom{N}{K}}$$

3. **2 entries in common:**
   $$P(X = 2) = \frac{\binom{K}{2}\binom{N-K}{K-2}}{\binom{N}{K}}$$

...

K. **K entries in common:**
   $$P(X = K) = \frac{\binom{K}{K}\binom{N-K}{0}}{\binom{N}{K}}$$

## Important Considerations

1. The sum of all these probabilities should equal 1, as they cover all possible outcomes.

2. The probability of having all K entries in common (P(X = K)) will be very small unless N is close to K.

3. The most likely number of common entries will depend on the ratio of K to N. If K is small compared to N, having few or no entries in common will be more probable. If K is close to N, having many entries in common becomes more likely[1].

4. This calculation assumes that the two vectors are independently and randomly generated, each with exactly K active entries.

5. In practice, for large N and K, you might need to use logarithms or other numerical techniques to calculate these probabilities accurately, as the binomial coefficients can become very large[2].
